## Reason

It can be helpful to know how much content is in a YouTube Playlist as well as how quickly you can get through it on various Playback Speeds. This is a feature I often find myself wanting, but YouTube doesn't natively support anything like this on their GUI. Additionally, I've gotten into listening to Podcasts recently so I wanted to include some way to parse the transcripts to make note-taking easier or to make the podcasts readable as well since sitting through an episode can be time consuming and inaccessible at times.
